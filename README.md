## Rami's pre-compiled Knomi v2 firmware

The official guide of BTT does not work for the Knomi V2. I have compiled firmware here with my custom graphics, and have updated instructions if you wish to make your own [here](https://knowledge.ramipastrami.engineering/books/3d-printing/page/knomi-v2-customization).

In general I do not like this device due to various issues it has, and BTTs inability to maintain accurate documentation. You can read more about my opinion [here](https://ramipastrami.engineering/the-knomi-v2-and-why-you-shouldnt-buy-it/).
